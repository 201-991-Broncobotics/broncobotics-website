					Estimates of the casualties from the Iraq War (beginning with the 2003
					invasion of Iraq, and the ensuing occupation and insurgency and civil
					war) have come in several forms, and those estimates of different
					types of Iraq War casualties vary greatly. Estimating war-related
					deaths poses many challenges.[1][2] Experts distinguish between
					population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the
					population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely
					significantly underestimate casualties.[3] Population-based studies
					produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from
					151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health
					Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research
					Business (ORB) survey). Other survey-based studies covering different
					time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of
					June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90%
					of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body
					counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009
					(Associated Press). The Iraq Body Count project documents
					185,000â€“208,000 violent civilian deaths through February 2020 in their
					table. All estimates of Iraq War casualties are disputed.[4][5]
